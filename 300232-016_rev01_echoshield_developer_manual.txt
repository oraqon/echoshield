2.2 10Gb Ethernet Interface
Ports, Services, and Protocols
The 10Gb interface provides Radar RDMap data to the user. The 10Gb interface is a hardware accelerated interface, only supporting UDP data over Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) network with no dynamic
addressing, no security, and no network management support.
The 10Gb protocol layer is designed to support an MTU size of 9000 and jumbo frames of 9216 bytes.
Given the Radar data rates, using a standard 1500 MTU size leads to a very high packet per second rate
limiting overall system performance. Ethernet switches, test devices, and sensor processing computers on
the 10Gb network must support jumbo frames.
The 10Gb Ethernet interface supports the standard Ethernet services of Ping (ICMP) and ARP only. No
support for Multicast (IGMP) or VLANs is provided. No support is provided for DHCP as the user’s network
for Radar RDMap data is assumed static. Domain Name Servers (DNS) and Domain Name Search Path are
not supported.
10Gb IP settings are changed using Echodyne-defined control messages over the 1G Ethernet interface.
Upon initial delivery, the default IP address for this interface is defined by the control parameters listed on
this page: 10Gb Network Parameters Specification.

3 Commands - (REQ/RSP)
This section documents the Radar Commands that are exposed by the API for Users to configure and control
the Radar.

3.1 Data Exchange Format
The data exchange format follows a modified version of JSON-RPC 2.0 where we drop the jsonrpc version
indicator field.
A single command exchange consists of a User Request (REQ) followed by a Radar Response (RSP).
User Request messages are expected to be terminated by the character sequence: “\r\n” . Radar Responses
will be terminated in the same way.
An example of a simple User REQ:
{
"method": "method_name", // STRING: The name of the Radar method to invoke.
"id": 1,
// INTEGER: An incrementing integer message␣
˓→identifier
}
Some commands contain parameters and will include the params object:
{
"method": "method_name", // STRING: The name of the Radar method to invoke.
"params": {},
// OBJECT: An object containing method parameters
"id": 1,
// INTEGER: An incrementing integer message␣
˓→identifier
}
When the User Request succeeds, the Radar Response will be in a Success Response format, which is based
on the “method” and “params” objects of the User Request.
Radar RSP for success example
{
"result": {},
empty.
"id": 1,

// OBJECT: The result of the invoked Radar method, possibly␣

˓→

// INTEGER: The same identifier corresponding to REQ

}
User Requests can fail for several reasons. In these cases, the Radar Response will be in the Error Response
format, defined as follows:

ECHODYNE PROPRIETARY - SUBJECT TO NDA OR PIA

Doc #: 300232-016 | Rev: 01 | Page 9 of 269

{
"error": {
"code": 1,
"message": "REASON"
},
"id": 1,
˓→REQ
}

// INTEGER: Error code
// STRING: Brief description of the error
// INTEGER: The same identifier corresponding to␣

The ‘code’ field of the error object indicates the type of error the radar encountered, while the ‘message’
field gives specific details about the error. Error codes are detailed in the table below:
Code

-32700
-32601

Fail
ParseError
MethodNotFound

-32602

InvalidParams

-32603

InternalError

-32000

AlreadyConnected

Generic failure code, see ‘message’ field for details.
Missing or invalid ‘method’, ‘id’ or ‘params’ fields.
Command request JSON contains a ‘method’ that the radar does not
recognize, or no ‘method’ at all.
Invalid Parameters included in the ‘params’ field, such as values out
of range, incorrect types, or missing required parameters.
Failure to parse incoming command due to invalid JSON or lack of
system resources.
Sent to all client connections made beyond the first before the connection is closed.

3.2 Role Authentication
Each command described in the API lists the Roles for which the command can be used.
Any connected client is automatically authenticated to the USER role. The USER role includes the get_idn
command which allows the client to get identifying information about the connected radar as well as the
authorize_role and get_session_id commands which allow authorization of additonal roles.
Authenticating a non-USER Role requires two pieces of information:
• A public key file provided by Echodyne for a specific role
• A Radar Command session ID
Session IDs are generated once per network connection to the Command port on the Radar. If the client
disconnects from the radar, the authorized roles for that session are no longer authorized, and must be reauthorized with a new session ID.
To authenticate, client apps should
• Query for the current session ID using the get_session_id command.

• Encrypt the session ID using the role-specific public key file contents and the RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5
encryption scheme.
• Encode the encrypted bytes as Base64 ASCII.
• Include the resulting characters in the key field of the authorize_role command.
Attempting to use a command that is not allowed under the currently authenticated roles will cause the AUTH
error to be returned. See the documenation for the command to learn which role needs to be authenticated
to use that command. If there is more than one role for a command, the command is authenticated if at least
one of the listed roles is authenticated.

{
"method": "authorize_role",
"params": {
// STRING: The role to authorize
"role": "SUPER_USER",
// STRING: The UUID for this session
"uuid": "47578539-4850-459a-8b81-3c249a82132d",
// STRING: The Base64-encoded bytes represeting the encrypted UUID

User Roles
Authorizing a role grants access to the set of commands and parameters associated with that role. All authorizable roles and a high-level description of what API is granted access per role are listed in the table
below:
Role

API Made Accessible

USER (authorized by default)
SUPER_USER
FIELD_UPGRADE_USER

All API neccessary to set up and run the radar.
Configuration commands/parameters for fine-tuning of radar operation.
All commands related to field-upgrades of the radar firmware.

3.3 Missions
The RadarApp command API provides commands that allow for the listing (list_missions), licensing (license_mission), and selection (configure_mission) of missions. Selection of a mission configures the radar
in a fashion that optimizes its ability to detect, track, and classify a particular class of targets, this includes
setting the default values of various user-facing RadarApp parameters to mission-specific values.
This section describes each of the configurable missions.
C-UAS_1
The C-UAS_1 mission is optimized to provide air space situational awareness against group 1 UAS at ranges
less than 4km. The mission has been designed to provide a minimum track acquisition range of 150 meters, a
minimum blind range on tracked targets of 100 meters, and a 50% track acquisition range on a -20 dBsm target
of 2.5km. This mission is expected to be able to track ground targets in a limited capacity. The C-UAS_1
mission is recommended for customers looking to track group 1 UAS and smaller targets.
C-UAS_2
The C-UAS_2 mission is optimized to provide air space situational awareness against group 1-3 UAS at
ranges up to 15km. The mission has been designed to provide a minimum track acquisition range of 500
meters, a minimum blind range on tracked targets of 100 meters, and a 50% track acquisition range on a -20
dBsm target of 2.5km. This mission is expected to be able to track ground targets in a limited capacity. The
C-UAS_2 mission is recommended for customers looking to track group 1-3 UAS or targets of similar size
and speed.

DISMOUNT
The DISMOUNT mission is optimized to provide ground situational awareness at ranges up to 15 km. The
mission has been designed to provide a 50% track acquisition range on a -3 dBsm target (human) of 8km.
This mission is not expected to be able to detect and track airborne targets. The DISMOUNT mission is
recommended for customers interested in tracking targets on the ground.
COASTAL_C-UAS
The COASTAL_C-UAS mission is optimized to provide air space situational awareness against group 1-3
UAS operating over water at ranges up to 15km. The mission set uses proprietary algorithms to estimate
the direction and velocity of waves and reduce the number of detections, and ultimately tracks, generated by
those waves. The mission has been designed to provide a minimum track acquisition range of 500 meters,
a minimum blind range on tracked targets of 100 meters, and a 50% track acquisition range on a -20 dBsm
target of 2.5km. The COASTAL_C-UAS mission is recommended for customers looking to track group 1-3
UAS or targets of similar size and speed that are operating over water.

get_radar_kinematics_geodetic
Get user-set geodetic radar kinematics. A user can use altitude_type as an optional input parameter to specify
the vertical datum used for the returned altitude. If no altitude_type is provided, orthometric is used by
default.

Description

Type

altitude_type

Optional
Defines the vertical datum used for the given
altitude.
The ellipsoidal
height/altitude refers to the
height above the ellipsoid.
Echoshield assumes use
of the WGS84 ellipsoid.
Orthometric altitude is the
height above the geoid, which
represents mean sea level
and is determined by Earth’s
gravity. Echoshield assumes
use of the EGM96 geoid,
but should not be sensitive
to other geoid models. It is
important to explicitly define
whether a given altitude is
the height above the ellipsoid
or geoid as these can differ
by as much as ~90 meters
depending on where you are
in the world.

altitude_type

Defines the vertical datum used for the given
altitude.
The ellipsoidal
height/altitude refers to the
height above the ellipsoid.
Echoshield assumes use
of the WGS84 ellipsoid.
Orthometric altitude is the
height above the geoid, which
represents mean sea level
and is determined by Earth’s
gravity. Echoshield assumes
use of the EGM96 geoid,
but should not be sensitive
to other geoid models. It is
important to explicitly define
whether a given altitude is
the height above the ellipsoid
or geoid as these can differ
by as much as ~90 meters
depending on where you are
in the world.

latitude_deg

WGS84 latitude of the reference frame origin in degrees
WGS84 longitude of the reference frame origin in degrees
Altitude of the reference
frame origin in meters. The
vertical datum used to define
the altitude can be specified
with the altitude_type field.
By default, the altitude is assumed to be the orthometric
height (MSL). If defining
the ellipsoidal altitude, the
altitude should be referenced
from the WGS84 ellipsoid. If
defining the orthometric altitude, the altitude should be
referenced from the EGM96
geoid.
The right-handed yaw of the
radar frame around the ENU
frame’s z-axis, in degrees.
This is the first rotation applied in the Yaw-Pitch-Roll
sequence, meaning the rotation is applied relative to the
ENU frame

pitch_enu_deg

The right-handed pitch of the
radar frame around the yawrotated frame’s y-axis, in degrees. This is the second rotation in the Yaw-Pitch-Roll
sequence, meaning it is applied after the yaw rotation
and is relative to the yawrotated frame.
The right-handed roll of
the radar frame around
the
pitch-and-roll-rotated
frame’s x-axis, in degrees.
This is the final rotation in
the Yaw-Pitch-Roll sequence,
meaning it is applied after
both yaw and pitch rotations,
relative to the already-rotated
frame.
Defines the vertical datum used for the given
altitude.
The ellipsoidal
height/altitude refers to the
height above the ellipsoid.
Echoshield assumes use
of the WGS84 ellipsoid.
Orthometric altitude is the
height above the geoid, which
represents mean sea level
and is determined by Earth’s
gravity. Echoshield assumes
use of the EGM96 geoid,
but should not be sensitive
to other geoid models. It is
important to explicitly define
whether a given altitude is
the height above the ellipsoid
or geoid as these can differ
by as much as ~90 meters
depending on where you are
in the world.

track_focus_start
Start focusing on a particular track. This command requires the user to give a track identifier (uuid or trackId),
the particular type of track identifier (TRACK_UUID, HANDOFF_UUID, or TRACK_ID), and the type of
track focus desired (PRIORITY_TRACK or SINGLE_TARGET_TRACK). ‘uuid’ and ‘track_id’ are semioptional (only one is required), while ‘track_identifier_type’ and ‘focus_type’ are both required. If identifying the track via TRACK_UUID or HANDOFF_UUID, the ‘uuid’ field must be given. If identifying the
track with TRACK_ID, the ‘trackId’ field must be given. If an optional field is given that does not correspond
with ‘track_identifier_type’, it is ignored. If selecting the PRIORITY_TRACK focus type, the system will
reallocate all of its search and classification beam resources to interrogate the region around the specified
track, but will continue to look back at existing tracks. If selecting the SINGLE_TARGET_TRACK focus
type, the system will reallocate all of its beam resources to interrogate the specified track. This will result in
all other tracks not in the vicinity of the selected target to coast until they are eventually killed. In both cases,
the radar will continue to acquire new targets in the vicinity of the selected target. PRIORITY_TRACK
should be used in cases where the user wants to maintain existing tracks while SINGLE_TARGET_TRACK
should be used if the user wants to maximize accuracy on the specified track.

track_handoff
Handoff track estimate to the radar that was generated from another source. The user must provide the optional estimate parameter that matches the format parameter. The time the estimate was measured must
also be provided in the unix_time_ns parameter and the time sources must be synchronized with the radar.
The uuid parameter will populate the track’s handoff_uuid field. If uuid is not provided one will be generated on the radar and sent in the command response so the user can associate the data. The rcs_dBsm and
rcs_std_dBsm optional parameters will only be used if both are provided.
Track handoffs should be limited to 1000 per second when RCS values are provided and to 2 per
second when no RCS values are provided. Exceeding these handoff limits can cause a reduction in the track update rate, degradation in track accuracy and degradation in track acquisition
performance.

get_gps_data
Get GPS data. GPS mode will be reported as either 2D_Fix or 3D_Fix, assuming there are sufficient satellites
in view. Note: get_gps_data will always report altitude as orthometric height above the geoid to match what
is reported by the internal sensor. If ellipsoidal height is needed, the get_ins_data can be used as long as
the get_gps_data command is returning a GPS mode of 3D_Fix, otherwise the reported altitude may not be
correct.

4 Parameters
This section describes the set of Radar Parameters used by the API to configure the Radar.
Each set of Parameters is linked to a Group which exposes a single command to modify the Parameters
belonging to that Group. There is also a single command per Group used to query the current value of the
Parameters in that Group.
• System Parameters can be set using the set_sys command and queried using the get_sys command.
• Network Parameters can be set using the set_net command and queried using the get_net command.
• RadarApp Parameters can be set using the set command and queried using the get command.

4.1 Parameter Attributes
Each parameter in this section is described by a set of attributes, detailed below:
Default
Factory default value of the parameter.
Type
JSON type of the parameter.
Constraints
Constraints that define the range of acceptable values for the parameter. Constraints of None indicates that
the parameter will accept any value appropriate for its type.
Nullable
Whether the parameter can be set to null or None.

Modifiable Mode
Indicates which mode the radar must be in to set the parameter value. The two applicable modes are:
• Operation - Default mode
• Service - Mode for adjusting radar configuration. Can be entered and exited with the commands
enter_service and exit_service.
Some modifiable parameters can only be modified while the radar is in Service mode. The rest can be
modified either in Operating or Service states.
Some parameters are not modifiable, these will display a Modifiable Mode of “Read Only”.
The radar will respond to ‘set’ commands with a STATE error if attempting to set a parameter that cannot
be set in the current mode.
Persistence
Describes what operations will reset the parameter to its factory default value.
• Persistent Parameters can only be reset using the Factory reset process.
• Sticky Parameters can be reset by parameter group to their default values using the associated reset
command, see available reset commands below.
• Volatile Parameters will be reset to their default value on the next system boot.

detection_clutter_max_angle_above_ground_deg
The maximum elevation angle of a detection in degrees, relative to ground elevation angle, at which
the stationary clutter mask will be applied. Detections above this elevation angle and above detection_clutter_max_height_above_ground_m will not be masked even if they have a radial velocity that falls within the specified stationary clutter region. If there are many undesired tracks that
correspond to stationary objects with a reported elevation angle above ground greater than detection_clutter_max_angle_above_ground_deg, this parameter can be increased to help remove those tracks.

detection_clutter_max_height_above_ground_m
The maximum height of a detection in meters, relative to the ground, at which the stationary clutter mask will
be applied. Detections above this height and above detection_clutter_max_angle_above_ground_deg will not
be masked even if they have a radial velocity that falls within the specified stationary clutter region. If there
are many undesired tracks that correspond to stationary objects with a reported height above ground greater
than detection_clutter_max_height_above_ground_m, this parameter can be increased to help remove those
tracks.

value will decrease the likelihood things such as trees swaying in the wind will generate tracks, but
will also decrease the radar’s ability to track slow moving targets in the region defined by detection_clutter_max_height_above_ground_m and detection_clutter_max_angle_above_ground_deg.

higher PFA is recommended where clutter is limited and detecting objects at maximum range is critical.

5 Data
This section documents the format of each data packet type made available to users for capture. Raw radar
data in the form of Rdmaps are made available on the 10Gb interface. Processed Tracks, Detections and
Measurements are transmitted on the 1Gb interface, along with Beams, Status, and Kinematics data.
The following flow-chart is a brief overview of radar data packet processing:

5.1 Variable Packet Size
Several data types may vary in individual packet size. These packets contain a fixed section that always
appears once at the start of a packet, and 0 or more variable sections appended at the end of the packet based
on the amount of data in the pipeline.
For example, a Detections packet has a fixed section size of 64 bytes (header), and a variable section size of
184 bytes (detections). The number of detections in the packet is reported by the n_detect field in the header.
So the total packet size is as the following table shows:

The following packet types have variable packet sizes:
• Detections
• Measurements

5.2 1Gb Interface
This section describes the following output packet schemas:
• Tracks
• Representative
• Status
• Kinematics
• Detections
• Beams
• Measurements
• Cookies
Tracks
Contains data about active tracks, including state and class estimates for reported targets. Track packets are
transmitted at a configurable rate per the tracks_output_rate_hz parameter. In a single track output period,
one NULL track packet and one standard track packet per active track are generated. NULL track packets
are packets with header information only that are indicated with an ‘id’ field equal to ‘0’. These packets may
serve as separators between track-output periods, as they are always the first packet sent per period.
Packet data is in little-endian byte order.

Representative
A representative track comes from a track group and summarizes that group. A track group is defined as a
set of tracks that all represent the same target. Track groups are formed by associating tracks from multiple
radars that are on the same target and is performed by some central processing routine. A representative track
contains all of the same core information as a radar track such as target state and class estimates. Representative track updates are emitted asynchronously at the rate the representative state estimate is updated. This
should correspond to the rate at which the central processing unit receives track updates from the various
radars it is connected to.
Packet data is in little-endian byte order.

Status
Contains data about current system state. Status packets are sent at a user-configurable nominal rate, which
defaults to 1 Hz. On special events, such as time source status, PLL Lock status, safety-interlock state, system
mode, SBIT status or CBIT status, a status packet is sent immediately. Status ports are enabled as long as
the system is up and running, regardless to whether it is actively radaring or whether it has entered fault state
(except when there is a fault in the 1G network interface). Packet data is in little-endian byte order.

5.3 10Gb Interface
This section describes the following output packet schemas:
• Rdmaps
Rdmaps
The 10G radar data interface is used to output raw radar data in the form of Range Doppler Maps to the user.
A Range Doppler Map reports the complex signal received by the radar corresponding to a given range and
doppler. Packet data is in big-endian byte order.
Each reported beam will include a Metadata packet which describes the beam that has generated the information including the data product shape. Following the metadata packet area a series of data packets that
comprise the RD Map data. These data packets include the total number of data packets that comprise the
beam and the index of the current data packet in that sequence.
This relationship is demonstrated visually below. Packet data is in big-endian byte order.

The following diagram illustrates the packet output stream and format of data that makes up the RDMap
outputs. The RDMap data is output post doppler FFT and therefore the samples are output first along
the ‘Doppler Slice’ dimension, then along ‘Range Slice’ dimension. Specifically, all samples for
Range[0] for each doppler bin are output sequentially, then all samples for Range[1] for each doppler

bin, etc. Each output sample is a complex pair, with imag being output first than real. Real and imag
are signed 32 bit integers output in network byte order (big-endian).

Due to MTU constraints for the 10G link, data is split into packets with a maximum number of data
bytes per packet limited to 8192 bytes, plus the 32 header bytes. The design supports a maximum of
4096 doppler bins; this means that up to 4 packets may be used per doppler slice. For RDMaps with
less doppler bins, only the required number of packets are used. The final packet in each doppler slice
may be less than 8192 bytes.
For example, consider a RDMap of M=128 range bins and N=1050 doppler bins. This would result
with the first packet being 8192 data + 32 header bytes, consisting of the first 1024 Range[0], doppler
bins(0,1023). The second packet would be 208 data + 32 header bytes, with the remaining doppler
bins(1024-1049) for Range[0]. This would be followed by an 8192 data + 32 header bytes which is the
start of the next range bin[1], doppler bins(0,1023), and so on. This results in a total of 1 metatdata
packet followed by 256 data packets (2 packets per range bin).

6 Initiated Built-in Test (IBIT)
Initiated Built-in Tests are used to diagnose and troubleshoot radar operation.

6.1 Antenna Diode Check
The ibit_antenna_diode_check() request instructs the radar to perform a test on the antenna diodes. The
results are returned in a nested list structure that represents an array that is 17 by 8 by 16 integers. Each
integer is a bitmap represented in decimal. Note that the row and column are 1 based in their numbering
even though the array is generally considered 0 based in JSON. The driver, however, is 0 based.
Interpreting the Output of ibit_antenna_diode_check Command
The annotated “faults” output below shows how to interpret the arrays that come out of the
ibit_antenna_diode_check response.:
"faults": [
[ # Column 1 (note that columns are 1 based)
# (Note that rows are 1 based)

Intepreting the Driver Integers
The integers in the inner most list represent a bitmap of the possible faults. This table indicates which faults
are represented by the bits 1, 2, 4, and 8.
bit

Meaning

1
2
4
8

Short to Vneg
Short to Vss
Short to Vcc or Vhv
Short to drive

The most common value is 0 which means that the diode has no faults.
The example faults output shows some faults.
Columns 10 and 11 have multiple faults. The 1 indicates a short to VNeg was detected. The 2 indicates a
short to Vss was detected.
Column 13, row 3, driver 13 also has a single fault.

Continuous Built-in Tests are used to diagnose and troubleshoot radar operation and are run at the CBIT
interval, 2 seconds. Each fault or warning with _LOCAL or a number appended corresponds to a particular
temperature, voltage or current. LOCAL corresponds to the first temperature, voltage, etc in each array and
the numbers correspond to the following values. LOCAL corresponds to the temperature at the chip itself,
the rest are sensors in other locations.

9 Kinematics Setup Guide
9.1 Introduction
Because the radar uses the placement of terrain in its field of view to optimize its search and track behavior,
it will not operate correctly unless it is made aware of its global position and orientation. A user is therefore
required to give it that information using one of the set_x_kinematics Radar App Commands before the radar
can be operated.
This documentation uses the term kinematics to refer to the position, orientation, linear velocity, and angular
velocity of the radar; however, this chapter will only apply to cases where linear and angular velocity are zero.
This chapter will also deal with setting up a single radar using Echoshield’s API. For all other cases, and for
further explanations, please refer to later chapters.

9.2 Setting Kinematics Before Radaring
The radar won’t operate if it is not told its kinematics, so a call to one of the kinematics setters is required
before mode_set_start can be called. The best way to do this manually is the set_radar_kinematics function,
but set_reference_kinematics_ecef and set_reference_kinematics_geodetic are also available. This chapter
of the doc will only cover the use of set_radar_kinematics; to learn about the other setters please refer to
Echoshield Coordinate Frame Definitions and Reference Frame Guide.
In general, the kinematics can be set in any radar mode; therefore, the initial kinematics setup can be done
in either service or idle states.

9.3 Using the set_radar_kinematics Command
To inform the radar of its location and orientation in the world, the set_radar_kinematics function takes seven
arguments:
• latitude_deg in degrees
• longitude_deg in degrees
• altitude_m in meters above mean sea level or above the WGS84 ellipsoid (see the altitude-type argument below).
• heading_deg in degrees from north. It is measured clockwise so that a heading of 90 degrees will
point due east.

• pitchback_deg in degrees. This is the angle between the broadside beam and the level plane at the
radar’s location. It is oriented so that a positive angle points the radar above the horizon.
• tilt_deg in degrees. This is a left-handed rotation around the radar’s ‘broadside’ or z-axis. In other
words, if you were standing and facing with your chest oriented in the same direction as the radar, a
positive tilt would move your left shoulder down and right shoulder up. A user should always try to
level the radar and minimize tilt.
• altitude-type modifies the altitude_m to mean either the number of meters above mean sea level as
defined by the EGM96 model (also referred to as a geoid) with the parameter “orthometric”, or the
number of meters above the WGS84 ellipsoid with the parameter “ellipsoidal”. The difference between
these two measurements can be as great as 90 meters, so it is important that it matches the sensor.
It should be noted that the heading, pitchback, and tilt are calculated as Euler angles, meaning they should be
measured in the order heading, pitchback, tilt. A sensor may output orientation that is derived in a slightly
different way, so an engineer debugging the system may want to confirm that the angles they are inputting
are defined the same way.
Also, this command assumes that the radar is stationary.
set_reference_kinematics_ecef .

For nonzero velocity, please refer to

9.4 Checking the Current Kinematics
There are several ways to check the radar’s kinematics after they’ve been set. Two such commands are
recommended after using set_radar_kinematics:
• get_radar_kinematics: this returns the kinematics the radar is currently using, and should return exactly
what was set with set_radar_kinematics.
• get_ins_data: outputs what the internal sensors measure for kinematics. If the INS solution is valid, it
should report values that are close to those reported by get_radar_kinematics.
The kinematics commands also report a “kinematics_quality” response, which declares how well the user-set
kinematics align with the onboard INS’s kinematics solution. This information is also available in the 1G
Status output packet: Status.
The INS is subject to a few limitations. It should not be used when the radar is lying on its back or front, as
pitchback measurements close to 90 degrees will result in numerical instability from gimbal lock. Also, the
INS relies on a good GPS connection and will not report a valid solution if the GPS is blocked.

9.5 Streaming Kinematics
In the case where kinematics needs to be repeatedly updated over time (such as when the radar platform
moves), a kinematics_input_port UDP port is made available that accepts kinematics setter commands. This
allows a user to repeatedly update kinematics without tying up the comand port.
The commands sent to the kinematics_input_port port should be in the same JSON format as any command
sent to the radar command port. Accepted commands are:
• set_radar_kinematics
• set_reference_kinematics_ecef
• set_reference_kinematics_geodetic
While any of the three commands are accepted through the kinematics port, note that set_radar_kinematics
and set_reference_kinematics_geodetic only support use cases where the radar frame has zero-velocity with
respect to the ECEF frame. In any case where the radar frame has a non zero-velocity with respect to the
world, the set_reference_kinematics_ecef command should be used.
The radar will accept kinematics input at rates up to 125 commands per second. If commands are sent at a
higher rate, radar kinematics will be set at 125Hz using only the most recent command received per update
period.
The id field of the these commands should be incremented for each successive message. If the radar receives
a command with an id value that is not an increment of the last one received, it will issue a warning to its
syslog.
For each command sent to the kinematics_input_port, a kinematics packet will be generated and output on the
kinematics_port. Users are encouraged to monitor the kinematics output port to ensure that radar kinematics
are being updated as they expect.

9.6 Measuring and Setting Kinematics with the Sunsight AAT
Echodyne uses a SunsightTM Antenna Alignment Tool (AAT) to measure the location and orientation of
EchoShield radars used in stationary applications.

Fig. 1: Sunsight AAT azimuth, tilt, and roll directions and axes with the AAT faces back setting in app.
The AAT reports location in standard geodetic latitude, longitude, and height-above-mean-sea-level (A.K.A.
orthometric) altitude coordinates, but it reports orientation in a custom format. The AAT reports three Euler
angles for four different AAT mountings. Use the AAT faces back setting. Using a different setting will
rotate the nominal AAT reference frame, and cause the conversions to heading, pitchback, and tilt to change.
For this setting, the reported angles are:
Azimuth - The left-handed rotation about the AAT’s z-axis (with zero azimuth when the AAT’s x-axis points
South). This is 180 degrees from the radar’s heading when mounted using the bracket.
Tilt - The right-handed rotation about the AAT’s y-axis with zero pitch when the AAT’s x-axis is level (in
the East-North plane).
Roll - The right-handed rotation about the AAT’s x-axis with zero roll when the AAT’s y-axis is level (in the
East-North plane).
These measurements correspond with the heading_deg, pitchback_deg, and tilt_deg definitions, respectively,
used by the set_radar_kinematics command (note that the command’s tilt_deg correspond with the AAT’s
Roll measurement, and not the AAT’s Tilt measurement). The AAT should measure 180 degrees Azimuth
when the AAT’s x-axis points south and the radar points north, if the AAT is attached to the radar using the
mounting bracket. If the AAT is measuring using its AAT faces back configuration a user can submit these
orientation angles into the set_radar_kinematics, with only the heading requiring alteration.
In summary,
1. Use Sunsight faces back setting in the Sunsight app.
2. Issue the set_radar_kinematics command with the following parameters:
• latitude_deg = latitudeAAT
• longitude_deg = longitudeAAT
• altitude_m = altitudeAAT
• heading_deg = azimuthAAT - 180
• pitchback_deg = tiltAAT

10 Echoshield Coordinate Frame Definitions
10.1 Introduction
An EchoShield radar can represent the state of its kinematics (position, orientation, linear velocity, and
rotational velocity) in several coordinate frames. This section defines those frames, along with some intended
uses for each.
Echoshield derives its coordinate frame definitions using earth models defined by the WGS84 ellipsoid and
the EGM96 geoid models.

10.2 Radar Frame
The radar frame refers to a coordinate frame that is centered on the face of the radar. The x-axis is defined
to come out the side of the radar, the y-axis out the top, and the z-axis out the front face, or ‘broadside’, to
complete the right-handed triad. ‘Right’ and ‘left’ refer to negative and positive x, respectively.
When talking about radar-frame Euler angles, the yaw, pitch, and roll angles are applied in that order and are
about the z, y, and x axes respectively.

Fig. 2: The radar frame with its Cartesian triad.
The radar’s antenna frame (also known as Azimuth-Elevation frame) has the same origin on the face of
the radar, but Azimuth and Elevation are degrees measured from broadside with positive defined as up (or
towards positive y) and left (towards positive x), respectively.

Similarly, UV coordinates generally are defined using radar face as origin and broadside as zero-u and zero-v.

10.3 ECEF Frame
The ECEF (Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed) frame is the most significant non-radar frame, as it is treated as the
basis upon which all other frames are defined.
It is a 3D Cartesian coordinate frame that is fixed to the rotating Earth. It is defined with the origin at the
center of the earth, x-axis extending through the prime meridian and equator (or 0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees
longitude), the y-axis extending through 90 degrees East and the equator, and the z-axis through the north
pole.
EchoShield’s ECEF model is as defined by the WGS84 earth model, meaning a given ECEF coordinate
will have a unique latitude, longitude and height-above-geoid. The radar’s kinematics treat the ECEF as a
non-inertial or fixed frame.

Fig. 3: The Earth-centered, Earth-fixed frame.

10.4 ENU Frame
The ENU (east-north-up) is a locally-defined 3D frame with its origin defined with a latitude and longitude.
From its origin, the x, y, and z axes point due east, due north, and up, respectively. Up is defined as the
normal direction to the WGS84 ellipsoid.
While the ENU frame can be centered in an arbitrary spot, ENU velocities tend to be relative to the world,
unless otherwise noted. This means that a moving radar’s ENU frame will be centered on the radar, but the
velocities will be with respect to the stationary ground.
Because the directions of east, north, and up change depending on where in the world the origin is, a user has
to be careful not to use coordinates from two different ENU frames without careful conversion. For instance,

if a target’s coordinates are found in an ENU frame that is centered on a radar, then it would be incorrect to
feed that information to a component that is expecting ENU centered on the user.

Fig. 4: Lines of Latitude and Longitude are drawn on a globe. cut-away shows the X, Y, and Z axes of the
Earth Centered Earth Fixed coordinate frame. An East-North-Up coordinate frame is shown for a particular,
arbitrary, (X, Y, Z) location.

10.5 Geodetic Frame
The term “geodetic” refers to the set of latitude, longitude, altitude, and right-handed Euler angles with
respect to the local ENU frame. While the latitude and longitude have concrete definitions (per WGS84),
altitude can be defined with respect to the ellipsoid or the geoid (see below), and Euler angles can have many
definitions.

10.6 Euler Angle (Yaw, Pitch and Roll) Conventions
Yaw, pitch, and roll are defined as being rotations around a body’s z, y, and x axes respectively. Euler angles
are found by first aligning two coordinate frames, then making the three rotations. EchoShield uses a YPR
convention of right-handed rotations applied intrinsically (meaning the rotations are applied to the rotated
body’s coordinate axes) in a Z-Y-X order (meaning the rotation is achieved by yawing around the z-axis,
pitching around y, and then rolling around x).
One consequence of this is that when finding Euler angles with respect to the ENU frame, a zero yaw, pitch
and roll means the radar is lying flat on its back. A standard orientation frequently seen in the field, with the
radar upright and broadside 20 degrees above the horizon, will give it 70 degrees of roll.

10.7 Heading, Pitchback and Tilt
The words yaw, pitch, and roll are overloaded, and Euler angles can be difficult to calculate. One way of
limiting confusion is by defining heading, pitchback, and tilt, to align with a user’s intuition of orientation.
These angles are the best way for a user to quickly set up the radar, using the set_radar_kinematics command.
Heading is defined with zero pointing due north. It is measured clockwise so that a heading of 90 degrees
will point the radar due east.
Pitchback is the angle between the radar’s broadside or z-axis beam and its local east-north plane. It is
oriented so that a positive angle points the radar above the horizon.
Tilt rotates around the radar’s broadside axis. It is a left-handed rotation around broadside, so if you were
standing and facing with your chest oriented in the same direction as the radar, a positive tilt would move
your left shoulder down and right shoulder up.
These angles are standard Euler angles as defined above, but converted to match these definitions. If an
engineer were to calculate these angles from a sensor, they would first find yaw, pitch, and roll with respect
to the ENU frame as a starting point.
• Heading would equal the inverse (negative) of the yaw with respect to ENU, plus 180 degrees.
• Tilt would equal the inverse of the pitch with respect to ENU.
• Pitchback would equal the inverse of the roll with respect to ENU, plus 90 degrees.
However, it should be noted that these angles are for manual entry, and if detailed sensor data is available it
is recommended to set the kinematics using the reference frame geodetic or ECEF radar commands.

Fig. 5: An example of a radar with 50 degrees of heading, about 20 degrees pitchback, and zero tilt.

10.8 Reference Frame
The reference frame is a tool for users of multi-radar or moving radar installations to more quickly apply
sensor data to the radar. A user can define offsets between the reference frame and the radar frame, and with
the assumption that these offsets are unchanging, apply sensor data to the reference frame without needing
to convert to the radar frame.
For more information, please refer to the Reference Frame Guide.

10.9 Quaternions
Quaternions are a way of representing rotations, an alternative to Euler angles. They are imaginary numbers
with one real and three imaginary components, usually labelled w, x, y and z, respectively.
While they are mathematically powerful, they aren’t useful to most people as a visualization tool. For this
reason, most commands that offer quaternions as an input or output will have a complimentary command
that offers Euler angles (for example, get_radar_kinematics_ecef , which returns a quaternion for rotations,
and get_radar_kinematics_geodetic, which returns Euler angles w.r.t. ENU).

10.10 Altitude Relative Ellipsoid and Geoid
There are two common ways to measure altitude of an object: the object’s height relative to the geoid and its
height relative to the ellipsoid. In EchoShield, these are defined as:
Ellipsoid refers to an ellipsoid as defined by the WGS84 earth model. It is a close approximation of the shape
of a deformed earth, but it is a simple surface and doesn’t reflect topography, subsurface densities, or other
qualiites that can have wide ranging impacts on targets, measurement devices, and human perception.
Geoid refers to the shape created by the EGM96 data model that attempts to quantify the sea level at each
point on the globe (many sources refer to it as Mean Sea Level), deriving the sea level from gravimetric data.
This is not a regular shape. It is a very lumpy sphere.
Most applications will default to presenting and using altitudes that are relative to the geoid, but will also
allow a user to specify which to use. This is important to pay attention to, as the difference between the two
approximations can be as much as 90 meters.

11 Reference Frame Guide
11.1 Overview
EchoShield includes a suite of tools enabling multi-radar and nonstationary radar systems. One of these tools
is the Reference Frame, which is one method of setting the position and orientation (the kinematics) of the
radar.
The reference frame is an extra Cartesian coordinate frame with which a user can input kinematics. It is
defined using static offsets, meaning that the radar frame and the reference frame are stationary with respect
to one another. Once a user has correctly calculated the position and rotation of the radar relative to the
reference frame, they can set the kinematics of the reference frame and the radar frame will automatically
update to its correct position.
This is useful because position and orientation sensors, such as inertial INS units, are rarely colocated, or
even defined with the same coordinate conventions, as a radar. And if a second radar is used, then a user can
simply find a second set of offsets, and then use one sensor measurement to update the kinematics of both
radars.

Fig. 6: The different coordinate frames involved in specifying the radar’s global position, orientation, velocity, and rotation rate. When using the set_reference_kinematics_geodetic() command there is an implicit use
of a local ENU Frame at the specified latitude and longitude to which the yaw, pitch, and roll rotations are
referenced.
This chapter will outline the usage of the reference frame and give instructions for how it can be used correctly.

11.2 Setting the Reference kinematics
There are four commands a user can use to set and retrieve the reference kinematics:
• set_reference_kinematics_ecef , which takes position, quaternion orientation, linear velocity, and rotational velocity, all with respect to ECEF.
• set_reference_kinematics_geodetic, which takes position and orientation in geodetic (latitude, longitude, altitude, and Euler angles with respect to ENU) coordinates. This command assumes zero velocity; therefore setting reference kinematics with the geodetic command while the radar is moving will
greatly reduce radar performance.
• get_reference_kinematics_ecef returns the same parameters as the setter. Use this command to view
the current ECEF reference frame kinematics.
• get_reference_kinematics_geodetic returns the same parameters as the setter. Use this command to
view the current geodetic reference frame kinematics.
Like all of the kinematics setters and getters, these commands can be called at any time, but the kinematics
must be set at least once before the radar can start transmitting. In addition, the radar-to-reference offsets
must be set using set_reference_frame_offsets prior to setting reference kinematics.
If a user sets kinematics using set_radar_kinematics, it will leave the reference frame offsets unaffected, and
will therefore update the position of both the radar frame and the reference frame.

11.3 Determining Radar-to-Reference Offsets
The radar-to-reference position and orientation offsets typically have to be determined by hand. Together,
the six values describe the position and rotation of the radar frame relative to the reference frame.
Reference frame offsets can be set with the set_reference_frame_offsets command, and must be set at least
once before the reference kinematics can be updated. They only need to be set once, and the offsets, like the
kinematics themselves, will persist unless the radar is power cycled. After setting the offsets, the kinematics
can be set any number of times and the same offsets will be applied to each update to derive the kinematics
of the radar. The offsets are:
• position_relative_to_reference_x
• position_relative_to_reference_y
• position_relative_to_reference_z
• rotation_relative_to_reference_yaw
• rotation_relative_to_reference_pitch
• rotation_relative_to_reference_roll
Position_relative_to_reference_x, position_relative_to_reference_y, and position_relative_to_reference_z
describe the linear position of the radar’s origin (center of the front face of the radar) in the reference frame’s
x, y, and z coordinate axes.
The parameters rotation_relative_to_reference_yaw, rotation_relative_to_reference_pitch, and rotation_relative_to_reference_roll are the right-handed rotations (in degrees) about the radar’s z-, y-, and
x-axes as defined in Echoshield Coordinate Frame Definitions. To determine them, start with the radar
reference frames aligned:

Fig. 7: Sequence of rotations used to specify the orientation of the Radar Frame relative to the Reference
Frame. Conceptually, the radar starts with its axes aligned with the Reference Frame’s axes, as shown. Then
the radar is rotated about it’s axes, one-at-a-time in the sequence shown, to get it into the final orientation
relative to the Reference Frame. Note that there are multiple possible sequences of rotations that can be used
to get to any final orientation, but most of the time only two are needed (for example a yaw rotation followed
by a pitch rotation, with no roll rotation applied).
Then, rotate the radar away towards its desired orientation. First measure the yaw around the radar frame’s
z-axis. The order of this matters: EchoShield Euler angles are intrinsic, meaning that they are rotations
around the radar frame’s coordinate axes (as opposed to extrinsic, where the angles are around the stationary,
or reference frame’s, coordinate axes), so next measure pitch around the radar’s newly rotated y-axis, then
roll around the radar’s new x-axis.

Fig. 8: Process to determine radar-to-reference offsets. a) The radar-to-reference relationship we want to
specify. b) Start with the radar’s axes parallel to the reference’s axes, then c) determine the yaw rotation
about the radar’s z-axis needed to orient the radar to its final orientation. Then d) determine the intrinsic
pitch arounnd radar’s y-axis (zero in this example), then roll rotation about the radar’s x-axis. After the
rotations, the radar has traveled from being aligned to the reference frame to the desired orientation.
Note that there is not a unique sequence of yaw, pitch, and roll rotations for a given final rotation, and other
values for these angles can achieve the same result.
After the offsets have been determined and a full set of kinematics data entered, a user should call
get_radar_kinematics and get_ins_data. A large difference between the results of these commands (> 0.01
degrees latitude and longitude, > 2 meters altitude, > 2 degrees yaw, pitch and roll) implies an incorrect
reference frame setup.

11.4 Example: Using a Sunsight AAT as the Reference Frame
A good example for setting up and measuring a reference frame uses the SunsightTM Antenna Alignment Tool
(AAT). Echodyne frequently uses the AAT to measure the location and orientation of EchoShield radars in
stationary applications.
This section is meant to provide an example for setting up a reference frame. For steps to use the Sunsight
AAT in a field deployment, please see the Kinematics Setup Guide.
The AAT reports location in standard geodetic latitude, longitude, and height-above-mean-sea-level (A.K.A.
orthometric) altitude coordinates, but it reports orientation in a custom format.

The AAT measures orientation as three Euler angles in one of four different AAT mountings. This guide will
use the AAT faces back setting. The other settings will rotate the reference frame and will require different
conversions for heading, pitchback, and tilt. For this setting, the reported angles are:
Azimuth - The left-handed rotation about the AAT’s z-axis (with zero azimuth when the AAT’s x-axis points
South). This is 180 degrees from the radar’s heading when mounted using the bracket.
Tilt - The right-handed rotation about the AAT’s y-axis with zero pitch when the AAT’s x-axis is level (in
the East-North plane).
Roll - The right-handed rotation about the AAT’s x-axis with zero roll when the AAT’s y-axis is level (in the
East-North plane).

Fig. 9: Sunsight AAT azimuth, tilt, and roll directions and axes with the AAT faces back setting in app.
To use a Sunsight AAT as the reference frame for an EchoShield radar we need to convert these non-standard
Euler angles to right-handed Euler angles relative to ENU.
The AAT’s “azimuth” angle is positive clockwise (left-handed about Up) and is zero when the Sunsight’s xaxis is pointed north. To make this a right-handed rotation we negate the sign of the azimuth value reported.
Since zero yaw w.r.t. ENU should have the x-axis pointed parallel to East, we add 90o to the sign-flipped
azimuth. Hence, yawENU = 90 - azimuthAAT . The AAT’s tilt angle is then the same as pitch, and the AAT’s
roll angle is roll.

Fig. 10: Sunsight AAT geodetic YPR rotations for AAT faces back setting in app. The AAT is shown in an
orientation of yaw = pitch = roll = 0o (azimuthAAT = 90o , tiltAAT = 0o rollAAT = 0o ).
The relationships between the reference frame’s geodetic YPR values and the AAT’s reported Euler angles
are then,
𝑦𝑎𝑤𝐸𝑁 𝑈 = 90𝑜 − 𝑎𝑧𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑡ℎ𝐴𝐴𝑇
𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ𝐸𝑁 𝑈 = 𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑡𝐴𝐴𝑇
𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝐸𝑁 𝑈 = 𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝐴𝐴𝑇
With the AAT’s geodetic YPR values sorted out, we now need to determine the position- and rotationrelative-to-reference values.

Fig. 11: Process to determine radar-to-reference offsets when using a SunsightTM bar as the reference. a)
The radar-to-reference relationship we want to specify. From this mounting we measure the position of the
center of the radar’s face in the AAT’s coordinate frame. To determine the rotations-relative-to-reference we
b) start with the radar’s axes parallel to the AAT’s axes, then c) determine the intrinsic yaw rotation needed
to orient the radar to its final orientation. Then starting from the orientation of the radar after it has been
yawed, d) determine the intrinsic roll rotation needed to put the radar in its final orientation relative to the
Reference Frame. We have applied zero pitch rotation.
Using the method from the previous section, we determine that the appropriate offsets are:
𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒_𝑡𝑜_𝑟𝑒𝑓 𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒_𝑥 = −0.035
𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒_𝑡𝑜_𝑟𝑒𝑓 𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒_𝑦 = 0
𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒_𝑡𝑜_𝑟𝑒𝑓 𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒_𝑧 = − 0.255
𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒_𝑡𝑜_𝑟𝑒𝑓 𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒_𝑦𝑎𝑤 = −90
𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒_𝑡𝑜_𝑟𝑒𝑓 𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒_𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑐ℎ = 0
𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒_𝑡𝑜_𝑟𝑒𝑓 𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒_𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙 = 90
In summary,

12 Internal INS Usage
12.1 Introduction
Echoshield units are manufactured with an internal Inertial Navigation System (INS) which filters measurements from the onboard IMU and GPS sensors, which can serve as a basic estimate of radar kinematics. This
chapter contains information on the features of the internal INS and defines its intended use cases.

12.2 Intended Use Cases
The internal INS is designed to operate under the following assumptions:
• Radar is stationary during use.
• GPS environment is ideal.
Since the filters in the internal INS are designed with the stationary case in mind, if the radar is moved while
powered on, the measurements taken from this movement will be ingested into the internal filters. If this
happens, the user should wait for 60 seconds before using the INS estimate. After that period, if all other
conditions of operation are met, the INS can be used as an estimate of radar kinematics.
A user can directly input the data from the get_ins_data output into the set_radar_kinematics command to
set kinematics; however, the internal estimate of heading will always have relatively high uncertainty, and

it is recommended for a user to use an external measurement of heading when possible. See the “Expected
Uncertainties” section below for more information on the uncertainties of the internal INS outputs.

12.3 Kinematics Output
An up-to-date INS solution can be accessed with the get_ins_data command. The command returns the
radar’s internal estimate of kinematics:
• latitude_deg, which is calculated from the internal GPS.
• longitude_deg, which is calculated from the internal GPS.
• altitude_deg, which is calculated from the internal GPS.
• heading_deg, which is calculated from the internal GPS and filtered using an exponential decay filter.
• pitchback_deg, which is calculated from the internal IMU and filtered using an exponential decay
filter.
• tilt_deg, which is calculated from the internal IMU and filtered using an exponential decay filter.
• quaternion_ecef_[w, x, y, z], which is a quaternion representation of the INS frame rotation w.r.t.
ECEF. This is derived from the heading, pitchback and tilt solutions.
For detailed definitions of the output data, see Echoshield Coordinate Frame Definitions.
The output also contains an altitude_type output parameter, which defines the output datum for the altitude
solution. The optional altitude_type input lets a user toggle the desired altitude output datum, which can be
either orthometric or ellipsoidal. See Echoshield Coordinate Frame Definitions for a detailed description of
the difference between ellipsoidal and orthometric altitude datums.

12.4 Solution Validity
The INS data also includes additional information about the solution. Before using the INS solution, a user
should refer to these parameters to ensure their validity:
• pitch_roll_mature describes the stability of the solution of the gravity-relative parameters pitchback
and tilt. It is the only source of validity for those two parameters.
• heading_mature is true if the INS has been filtering the heading_deg solution for long enough to have
a stable solution.
• gps_fix_mode is the satellite lock mode from the onboard GPS module. If it is NO LOCK, all of the
GPS-derived parameters should be considered invalid. If it is 2D, the altitude and heading should be
considered invalid. If it is 3D lock, the GPS module has a complete lock on a satellite constellation.
• gps_heading_valid is an additional flag from the GPS module describing the validity of the internal
heading solution. If it is invalid, the internal heading solution should be considered invalid.

Since the INS pitchback and tilt are derived only from the IMU sensor, its solution can be considered valid
if the pitch_roll_mature flag is valid, regardless of the state of the GPS sensor. The INS will update those
values separately from the GPS-derived values.
If any of these flags are false, their respective output parameter should be considered unreliable; for instance,
if the gps_heading_valid flag is true, but heading_mature is false, the internal heading solution should be
considered invalid.

12.5 Accelerometer Calibration
Newly-manufactured radars may have accelerometer calibration coefficients, which will improve the pitchback_deg and tilt_deg solutions. The presence of the enhanced calibration coefficients is determined by the
enhanced_accelerometer_cal parameter in the get_ins_data command and the get_idn command.
If enhanced_accelerometer_cal is false, the IMU-derived output will be less accurate. In this configuration,
the pitchback_deg and tilt_deg solutions will have higher expected error and should not be used as a direct
source of radar kinematics.
The GPS-derived parameters (latitude_deg, longitude_deg, altitude_m, and heading_deg) are unaffected by
the accelerometer calibration.

12.6 Expected Uncertainties in INS Solution
The following is the expected INS state errors of an Echoshield unit with enhanced accelerometer calibration
and valid states:
